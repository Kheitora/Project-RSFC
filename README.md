THIS PROJECT WAS MADE FOR A CONCERT CONDUCTOR. 
THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF A WEBSITE WITH AN EXTERNAL DATABASE. 
THE CONDUCTOR HAD GIVEN US 3 CRITERIA FOR MAKING THIS WEBSITE.
1. THE WEBSITE NEEDS TO HOLD ALL MY INFORMATION, SO THAT THE PEOPLE WHO USE MY WEBSITE KNOW HOW TO CONTACT ME AND KNOW WHO I AM.
2. THE WEBSITE NEEDS MUSIC FRAGMENTS FROM A COUPLE OF THE CONCERTS WHERE I CONDUCTED, TO SHOW PEOPLE WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF.
3. THE WEBSITE NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED TO A DATABASE, SO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED MY SERVICES CAN RESERVE THEM VIA THE WEBSITE.

THESE CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET WITH THE OK FROM THE CLIENT.
WE ALSO TRIED TO MAKE AN EXTRA FEATURE FOR THE CLIENT, CONSISTING OF A WEBPAGE WHERE THE CLIENT COULD EASILY MANAGE THE RESERVATIONS SO HE DIDNT HAVE TO GO TO THE DATABASE EVERYTIME.
UNFORTUNATELY, THE DEVELOPER THAT WAS MEANT TO DO THIS PART, DIDN'T MAKE THE DEADLINE AND DIDN'T MEET THE CRITERIA, SO THAT FEATURE DID NOT MAKE IT IN THE WEBSITE. (BUT IT IS INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT FILES)
